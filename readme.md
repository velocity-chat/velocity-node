# Velocity
A WIP decentralized blockchain based end to end enrypted messenger.

Lots of buzzwords, I know. This is just a project for me to experiment with decentralized technology, and blockchain mainly. End to end encryption is a must due to the "open" nature of the chain.

# Network
Network packets are encoded using [Servo's bincode](https://crates.io/crates/bincode) and [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde).

Im not using any async libraries because I don't like them.
